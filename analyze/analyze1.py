goal:
to analyze the relationship between the holds used and the grade's difficulty level.
input: 
2D list of label, each element containing one benchmark problem's used holds.
for example, 
V3 = [["A1","A2", "K18", etc], ["J18", "J7", "B18", etc], [etc]]
V4 = [["A3","A4", "K16", etc], ["J18", "J9", "B18", etc], [etc]]
etc

output:
graph that shows how much a holds appears on each grade.

for example, (make a graph out of this)

label = "A1"
"A1" appears on V3 problem 5 times,
"A1" appears on V4 problem 2 times,
"A1" appears on V5 problem 7 times, 
etc

label = "A2"
"A2" appears on V3 problem 1 times,
"A2" appears on V4 problem 0 times,
"A2" appears on V5 problem 11 times,
